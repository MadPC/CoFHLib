Just a heads up, this library does not go "live" until CoFH Framework 1.6.0.0, which will be released with Minecraft 1.6, whenever that is.

Also, it is safe to resolve any conflicting GUI-related by changing the underlying variables to "public" - there is no issue doing this.

Sorry for any confusion.
